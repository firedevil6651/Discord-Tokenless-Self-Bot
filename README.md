# Discord Tokenless Self Bot
  A Tokenless Discord Self Bot that I made using Python 3 and ChromeDriver. More features will come as I update the program. The program is open-source so if you think something is suspicious, you can check it for yourself!

# Usage
  The first thing you need to have to run this is Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once that is done, edit the config.json file and add your email and password, if you have 2FA, you will be asked for your code later. Once you have that done, run the bat file or the python file directly, and let the program run!

# Features

Current features include:

- Interactive command prompt
- Status switching

Features I plan to add if possible:

- Channel messaging
- Call Answering
- VC Joining
- Friend Adding
- Email and password changing
- Custom status setting
- Account switching
- Hypesquad switching
- Nitro plan switching

# Legality
  As this program doesn't use a Discord user token, I am not sure if this is against Discord TOS so don't say you haven't been warned, I am not responsible for anything that happens to you or your account(s). I, the creator will not be held accountable for anything that happens from any usage of this tool/program.
