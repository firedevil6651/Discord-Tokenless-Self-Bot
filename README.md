# Discord Token-less Self Bot
  A Token-less Discord Self Bot that has no other purpose but to keep you online, more features will come as I update the program. It uses ChromeDriver and Python to run. 

# Usage
  The first thing you need to have to run this is Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). Once that is done, edit the config.json file and add your email and password, if you have 2fa, make sure you put in your code to the json file aswell. Once you have that done, run the bat file, and let the program do it's magic!

# Legality
  As this program doesn't use a Discord user token, I am not sure if this is against Discord TOS so please be warned, I am not responsible for anything that happens to you or your account(s).
